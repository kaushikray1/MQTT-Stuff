Hardware and Configuration 

You will need 2 libraries "PubSubClient" and "WiFiManager" thanks to them :)

https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient
https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager

Hardware requirement are FET drive for pin 12,14,16 for driving the FET to drive RGB LED Strips

When the device is programmed it starts up with a soft AP with the name "IoT_Setup" (for more info see WifiManager Help)

Connect to the AP and configure the Iot node with SSID and password

To Reset the Network config connect a push button to GPIO 1 and Ground. Holding the button at powerup will reset Wifi config file

change the MQTT server settings as per your need and you are all set. 

A good video to configure MQTT proker on a pi can be found at 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsDHEDbyLfg 
or to use a online fre broker "io.adafruit.com" or Cloud MQTT can be used. 

A good Android MQTT app that i like is "MQTT Dash" can be found at Google Play. Its a free app with no adds.. 

Enjoy the Free software...
