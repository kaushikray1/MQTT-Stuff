Readme

Required Libraries:
  You will need 2 libraries "PubSubClient" and "WiFiManager" thanks to the authors really appreciate it :)
  Can be found at: 
  https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient
  https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager

Changes Required in the Code Before Downloading: 
  Change the MQTT server settings as per your need at the top of the code.
  A good video to configure MQTT broker on a Raspberry pi can be found at 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsDHEDbyLfg 
  or to use a online free broker like "io.adafruit.com" or Cloud MQTT 

Hardware requirement are: 
  FET driver on pin 12, 14, 16 for driving the LED FET. I used MCP1407 as FET drivers (8 Pin DIP) and  CSD18542KCS for FETS. These FETS are awesome they run very cold at 12v and I am driving 8, 5m meter 5050 RGB LED strips from SUPERNIGHT from Amazon. I also love these LED Strips as they are super bright, brighter than all the other ones I had before. I am providing a link below.

  I used a 3.3v LDO converting 12v to 3.3v.It gets pretty hot, plan to change it to a switching supply in future. 
  If you want a push button can be placed between GPIO 1 and ground (its optional for reseting the Node in case a reconfig of the network settings are required)
  I used ESP8266-E12 for these projects. All the GPIO's can be changed as per your need, just look for the pin definations at the top of the code. 

Setup After Hardware and software: 
  Step 1:
  When the device is programmed it starts up with a Soft AP with the name "IoT_Setup" (for more info see WifiManager Help)
  Connect to the AP and configure the Iot node with SSID and password.
  To Reset the Network config connect a push button to GPIO 1 and Ground. Holding the button at powerup will reset Wifi config file.

  A good Android MQTT app that I like and use is "MQTT Dash" can be found at Google Play. Its a free app with no adds.. Thanks to the Author
  
Note: The code also supports OTA update and so next time the code can be directly updated using the network ports.
